# Vanilla Node REST API

> Full CRUD REST API using Node.js with no framework

This is for learning/experimental purposes. In most cases, you would use something like Express in a feedbackion project

```
# Routes
GET      /api/feedbacks
POST     /api/feedbacks
GET      /api/feedbacks/:id
PUT      /api/feedbacks/:id
DELETE   /api/feedbacks/:id

```

## Usage

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in develpment
npm run dev

# Run in feedbackion
npm start
```

Feel free to add to this and create a PR. I plan on creating a better router, but if you'd like to do that, feel free
